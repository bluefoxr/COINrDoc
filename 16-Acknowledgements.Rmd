COINr, like all R packages, has been built off of the back of many other packages. Some that COINr uses in particular are:

* Plotly, for beautiful javascript plots
* ggplot2, for beautiful static plots
* reactable, for nice interactive tables
* shiny, for apps
* Various elements of the tidyverse, particularly dplyr

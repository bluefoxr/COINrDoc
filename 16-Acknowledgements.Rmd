The construction of this package was funded by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, in particular by the [Competence Centre for Composite Indicators and Scoreboards](https://composite-indicators.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). It was also developed with and inspired by colleagues from the same group.

COINr, like all R packages, has been built off of the back of many other packages. Some that COINr uses in particular are:

* Plotly, for beautiful javascript plots
* ggplot2, for beautiful static plots
* reactable, for nice interactive tables
* shiny, for apps
* Various elements of the tidyverse, particularly dplyr
